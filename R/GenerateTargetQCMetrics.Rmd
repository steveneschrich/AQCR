# Overview
This package involves generating many different QC metrics from various packages. Some are likely
redundant with each other, particularly with respect to simpleaffy and yaqcaffy. However, rather
than try to unify all of the results we just generate them all and store them as an object for
reporting.


# Data
As example data, we use the base package directory that has a couple of the MAQC data files in it.

```{r}
target_cels<-generate_QCMetrics("target",".")
```


# Save Results
So that other markdown can read this in, we save to current directory. The other markdowns are 
parameterized so that you can specify where this data lives.
```{r}
saveRDS(target_cels,file="target_cels.rds")
```
